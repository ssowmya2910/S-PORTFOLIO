        <p>

I am a third-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong passion for software development and web development. Since my first year, I have been actively working on enhancing my technical and problem-solving skills while maintaining a CGPA of 8.6, demonstrating my commitment to both academics and practical learning.  
<br/><br/>
I have a keen interest in competitive programming and algorithmic problem-solving, and I consistently practice on platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Coding Ninjas to refine my coding skills. My ability to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to different environments enables me to learn and implement technologies efficiently.  
<br/><br/>
Beyond coursework, I engage in self-driven projects and internships to gain hands-on experience in software development. I explore various programming languages, frameworks, and tools to stay updated with industry trends. My problem-solving mindset, combined with a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, allows me to build scalable and efficient solutions.  
<br/><br/>
I am an enthusiastic learner who thrives in collaborative and challenging environments. My goal is to continuously expand my expertise, contribute to innovative projects, and make an impact in the field of technology and software engineering. I am eager to take on opportunities that allow me to grow and apply my skills in real-world applications.</p>
