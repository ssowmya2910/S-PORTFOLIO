        <p>
          I am a third-year <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong> student with a strong passion for <strong>software development</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>.  
          <br /><br />
          I have a keen interest in <strong>competitive programming</strong> and problem-solving, consistently practicing on platforms like <em>LeetCode</em> and <em>GeeksforGeeks</em> to refine my coding skills.
          <br /><br />
          Beyond academics, I actively engage in <strong>projects</strong>  to gain practical experience. I explore various <strong>programming languages</strong>, <strong>frameworks</strong>, and <strong>tools</strong> to stay updated with the latest industry trends.
          <br /><br />
          I am a <strong>curious learner</strong> who thrives in collaborative environments. My goal is to <strong>contribute to innovative projects</strong> and make a positive impact in the field of technology.
